//! Defines traits for blocking (synchronous) and non-blocking (asynchronous)
//! communication with a Morgan server as well a a trait that encompasses both.
//!
//! //! Synchronous implementations are expected to create transactions, sign them, and send
//! them with multiple retries, updating blockhashes and resigning as-needed.
//!
//! Asynchronous implementations are expected to create transactions, sign them, and send
//! them but without waiting to see if the server accepted it.
